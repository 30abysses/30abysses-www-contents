# HTML5 charset: `utf-8` or what?

The question: when setting HTML5 charset, how to write `utf-8`?

Some variations include:

```
utf-8
UTF-8
utf8
UTF8
```

The answer: `utf-8`, and here is how to follow through W3C's
documentations to reach that conclusion:

1. HTML 5.2 specification, section
   [2.6.5. Extracting character encodings from meta elements](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/infrastructure.html#extracting-character-encodings-from-meta-elements)

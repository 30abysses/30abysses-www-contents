# C# vs. TypeScript: Basic Types, Object


# C# Object

* Keyword: `object`
* C# `object` is an alias for `System.Object` which all C# types inherit
  directly or indirectly from.
* C# `System.ValueType` inherits from `System.Object` and is inherited
  by all value types.
* See
  [Boxing and Unboxing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/boxing-and-unboxing)
  for more information about convertions between value types and
  reference types.


# TypeScript Object

* Keyword: `object`, `{`, `}`
* TypeScript `object` represents values that are not `boolean`,
  `number`, `string`, `symbol`; for example, arrays, tuples, functions.

# 學習：記憶編碼(memory encoding)

這篇是就記憶編碼(memory encoding) 的閱讀筆記整理。


## 實用資訊

* 記憶編碼方式有視覺、聯想、聲音、語義、觸覺、組織。
* 至今(2017-02-28)，記憶編碼的過程尚未被完整了解，但已知道記憶編碼的過程
  牽涉到神經突觸的生成／變動、蛋白質的合成／變動。
  * 記憶編碼的過程由短期記憶而起，轉換為長期記憶，最後是長期記憶的整合。
  * 短期記憶：生物反應變動蛋白質來影響神經突觸連結的強弱。
  * 長期記憶：神經突觸連結的新增、消失。
* 從神經科學的角度來看，增強神經元(neuron)之間突觸(synapse) 傳遞訊號強度
  的現像稱為 long-term potentiation 。
* 遺傳基因有可能對記憶能力有顯著的影響。
* 聯想編碼(elaborative encoding)是把新資訊與已知知識連結的過程。
  * 聯想編碼可以大幅改善長期記憶留存率。
  * 輔助記憶的學問稱之為記憶術(mnemonic)。
* 語義編碼(semantic encoding) 是把感官接受到的資訊與當時情景、背景、上下
  文連結的過程。
* 短期記憶(short-term storage)的編碼方式通常主要依賴聲音記憶編碼。

## Types

> Visual encoding is the process of encoding images and visual sensory
> information. This means that people can convert the new information
> that they stored into mental pictures

> Elaborative encoding is the process of actively relating new
> information to knowledge that is already in memory.  how we remember
> something depends on how we think about it at the time. Many studies
> have shown that long-term retention is greatly enhanced by elaborative
> encoding

> Acoustic encoding is the encoding of auditory impulses.  processing of
> auditory information is aided by the concept of the phonological loop,
> which allows input within our echoic memory to be sub vocally
> rehearsed in order to facilitate remembering

> Tactile encoding is the processing and encoding of how something
> feels, normally through touch.

> Organizational encoding is the course of classifying information
> permitting to the associations amid a sequence of terms.

> In general encoding for short-term storage (STS) in the brain relies
> primarily on acoustic rather than semantic encoding.

> Semantic encoding is the processing and encoding of sensory input that
> has particular meaning or can be applied to a context. Various
> strategies can be applied such as chunking and mnemonics to aid in
> encoding, and in some cases, allow deep processing, and optimizing
> retrieval.


## Long-term potentiation

> Encoding is a biological event that begins with perception. All
> perceived and striking sensations travel to the brain's thalamus
> where all these sensations are combined into one single experience.

> Encoding is achieved using a combination of chemicals and electricity.

> A phenomenon called long-term potentiation allows a synapse to
> increase strength with increasing numbers of transmitted signals
> between the two neurons.


## Molecular perspective

> The process of encoding is not yet well understood, however key
> advances have shed light on the nature of these mechanisms.

> These changes include the modification of neural synapses,
> modification of proteins, creation of new synapses, activation of gene
> expression and new protein synthesis. However, encoding can occur on
> different levels. The first step is short-term memory formation,
> followed by the conversion to a long-term memory, and then a long-term
> memory consolidation process.


### Synaptic plasticity

> Synaptic plasticity is the ability of the brain to strengthen, weaken,
> destroy and create neural synapses and is the basis for learning.  In
> the short term, synaptic changes may include the strengthening or
> weakening of a connection by modifying the preexisting proteins
> leading to a modification in synapse connection strength. In the long
> term, entirely new connections may form or the number of synapses at a
> connection may be increased, or reduced.


### Encoding and genetics

> Human memory, including the process of encoding, is known to be a
> heritable trait that is controlled by more than one gene. In fact,
> twin studies suggest that genetic differences are responsible for as
> much as 50% of the variance seen in memory tasks.


## Depth of processing


### Maintenance and elaborative rehearsal

> Maintenance rehearsal is a shallow form of processing information
> which involves focusing on an object without thought to its meaning or
> its association with other objects.

> elaborative or relational rehearsal is a process in which you relate
> new material to information already stored in Long-term memory.

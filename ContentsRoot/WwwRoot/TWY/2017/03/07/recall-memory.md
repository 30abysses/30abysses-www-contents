# 學習：記憶喚回(memory recall)

這篇是就記憶喚回(memory recall) 的閱讀筆記整理。


##  實用資訊

* 記憶喚回的種類有：
  * 自由喚回(free recall) ：在無提示的狀態下，以任意順序喚回記憶。
  * 提示喚回(cued recall) ：以提示喚回記憶。
  * 序列喚回(serial recall) ：在無提示的狀態下，以特定順序喚回記憶。
* 記憶喚回的理論模型：
  * 先蒐尋記憶再辨認出正確的資訊
  * 由背景環境提示而喚回記憶
* 記憶喚回能力會受到系列位置效應(serial position effect)影響：
  * primacy effect: 最先看到的東西，印像會比較深刻。
  * recency effect: 最近看到的東西，印像會比較深刻。
* 測試效應(testing effect)：與「只進行記憶編碼」相比，「進行記憶編碼後，
  輔以記憶喚回練習」，更能幫助記憶的形成。
* 序列喚回長期／短期記憶是不同的過程：
  * 序列喚回長期記憶是將資訊整體喚回。
  * 序列喚回短期記憶則是依靠資訊本身的同質性、順序（在序列中的位置、前後
    相鄰的資訊）來重組資訊序列。

> Recall in memory refers to the mental process of retrieval of
> information from the past. Along with encoding and storage, it is one
> of the three core processes of memory. There are three main types of
> recall: free recall, cued recall and serial recall.

> Two main theories of the process of recall are the two-stage theory
> and the theory of encoding specificity.


## Types


### Free recall

> Free recall describes the process in which a person is given a list
> of items to remember and then is tested by being asked to recall them
> in any order.

> Free recall often displays evidence of primacy and recency effects.


### Cued recall

> after participants learn something, testing their memory with mental
> operations helps later recall. The act of recalling instead of
> restudying creates new and longer lasting connection ... This
> phenomenon is commonly referred to as the testing effect.


### Serial recall

> Serial recall in long-term memory (LTM) differs from serial recall in
> short-term memory (STM). To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is
> repeated over time until it is represented in memory as a whole,
> rather than as a series of items. In this way, there is no need to
> remember the relationships between the items and their original
> positions.

> In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from
> one of two mechanisms. The first refers to ISR as a result of
> associations between the items and their positions in a sequence,
> while the second refers to associations between items.

> The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting
> that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item
> has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position.

> Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall
> performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same
> semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different
> semantic category). This suggests that semantic representations are
> beneficial to immediate serial recall performance.

> different effects are generally seen in serial recall studies with
> humans:
> 1. List length effect
> 2. Primacy and recency effects
> 3. Transposition gradients
> 4. Item confusion errors
> 5. Repetition errors
> 6. Fill-in effects
> 7. Protrusion effects
> 8. Word-length effects
